I don't mean to sound upset
But there's someone sleeping in our bed
Tell me how she makes you feel
When you say you love her is it real?
Is she hanging with your friends?
Cause I don't want to sound intense
Some of them still fuck with me
So is this how it's gonna be?

Fuck you I hate you I miss you I love you
Swear I regret it for saying I trust you
Right in the feels, yeah, right in the feels
I know how it feels and it probably kills

I'm the best you ever had
I'm the best you ever had
I'm the best you ever had, ever have, ever
That I'm the best you ever had
Yeah, I'm the best you ever had
I'm the best you ever had, ever had, ever

I wonder what you're doing now
Is it something that I would allow
Feel like texting you to check your mail
You would see our favorite store's on sale
I know you saw I dyed my hair
Why is this just so unfair?
I'm pretty sure your soul is dead
Cause I know she sucks at giving

Fuck you I hate you I miss you I love you
Swear I regret it for saying I trust you
Right in the feels, yeah, right in the feels
I know how it feels and it probably kills

I'm the best you ever had
I'm the best you ever had
I'm the best you ever had, ever had, ever
That I'm the best you ever had
Ye I'm the best you ever had
I'm the best you ever had, ever had, ever
