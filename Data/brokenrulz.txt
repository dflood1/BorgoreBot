I would bark like a dog at normal people
Spit my heart out in lonely rooms
I would burn the house down, while you are sleeping
And I ask myself of broken rules

I would shout at the clouds
That I'll whisper
Hide myself and cry for lost
Then I'll stand on the roof
Of our house and
Let my body turn into dust

I would bark like a dog at normal people
Spit my heart out in lonely rooms
I would burn the house down, while you are sleeping
And I ask myself of broken rules

Faithful
Testing on events
[2x]

I would bark like a dog at normal people
Spit my heart out in lonely rooms
I would burn the house down, while you are sleeping
And I ask myself of broken rules
