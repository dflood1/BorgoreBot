I'm sorry that I made it all the way to where I am today
I'm sorry that you cannot fuck with us 
Cannot Squad with us [x2]
I'm sorry that I made it all the way to where I am today
I'm sorry that you cannot fuck with us 
Cannot Squad with us [x2]

I'm simply better, 
Your girl so kinky, 
She says you haven't fed her,
I gave her a dick,
And now she's all a better,
She's with her girls they say "her boyfriend doesn't matter",
I guess you don't matter. 
Cause I'm simply better,
Can't remember shit,
No chill on the JÃ¤ger,
Woke up in a new house,
No chill on the acres,
No ghosts in my studio,
I make my own paper,
I guess she's just the faker,
Cause I'm simply better,
I'm simply better [x3]
(Can't squad with us)

I'm sorry that I made it all the way to where I am today 
I'm sorry that you can not fuck with us,
Can not squad with us [x2]

I'm sorry that I made it all the way to where I am today 
I'm sorry that you can not fuck with us,
Can not squad with us [x2]
