Now you say you're lonely
You cried the long night through
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
(Cry)

Now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Bitch
I cried a river over you
My favorite sex partner was a shampoo
Everyday praying for you to get a swine flu
Or to be raped by Bin Laden, and raped by his crew
So now you say that you are sorry
Please, you just want me back
'Cause I'm big in the showbiz
While I'll be cumming river
At a random DJ skank
You'll be crying rivers
At your rotten sperm bank
Cry bitch

(Cry) [x3]

You drove me
Nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember?
I remember all that you said
Told me love was to plebeian
