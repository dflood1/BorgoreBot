[Intro:]
Borgore is my sugar daddy

[Verse 1:]
I love to wear Fendi when I’m riding Bentley
I love to wear Prada when I ride your mother
I got so much money don’t know how to spend it
Might just buy your bitch and later I just rent it
Yes I love investments bitches think that I’m investment
Bitches want a monthly paycheck so they trying to get pregnant
People want free bottles so they coming to my table
Say they know me or someone on my label
She heard that I’m a DJ she asks me to fuck her
Really nice tits I ask her who’s her doctor
‘Cause this other girl I fucked was insecure during a threesome
Baby you are beautiful just suck me till my dick’s numb
Fuck I feel dumb just checked her on Instagram
Thought she had no boyfriend but I know her boyfriend
He’s a good kid - bitches have no morals
Bitch will drip in cum just for couple dollars

[Hook:]
People are fake, bitches love fame
They wanna be your friend just to mention your name
Yes I love this place but I hate this city
Everything is perfect nothing’s really pretty

[Verse 2:]
I got your bitch tiptoeing on my yacht deck
You think she loves you but she fucks me behind your back
Just being smart gotta take care of her babies
I’ll be blowing hundreds while you sweat for them twenties
I promised that I’ll call her now she wants apology
But so is all the people who’d been tricked by Scientology
You want apology? Here goes my apology!
I’m sorry I don’t give a fuck but you're still in love with me
It’s probably my Louis V or my cool apartment
I don’t have a license got Mercedes cause I want it
Sex full of cake bitches wanna try it
Making models swallow just to fuck their cocaine diet
Just fuck with their dreams bitch you're not an artist
Sleeping with directors doesn’t make you an actress
Sleeping with producers doesn’t make you a singer
Sleeping with big dreams - waking up a stripper

[Hook]
