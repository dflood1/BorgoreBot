[Intro:]
Oh it's the handsome, yeah

[Refrain:]
I'm on a lazy flex, I'm on a lady flex
Never at the gym, everyday I'm having sex
I'm on a lazy flex, I'm on a lady flex
Bitches fall in love, bitches love the rough sex
Slap her face, fuck her in the butt
Bitches like to know their place and I don't need to act
Hands around their neck, grab her by the hair
Girls with daddy issues, just like when you don't care

[Borgore:]
Everyday I'm having sex, never fucking hustling
Never need to work, bitches pay me to bust one in
When I'm done with dinner, I never see the bill
When I'm done with bitches, they start seeing Dr. Phil

When it's cold outside, I wear bitches as my coat
I don't need no swimsuit, I got bitches on my boat
Skinny fit tees, skinny fit jeans
Skinny fit bitches on my fingers, got rings

I pump up my girls, I give them slaps, I give them pinches
I don't need no fuel, I go Flintstones on my bitches
I don't need no driver's license, they can drive my car
Bitches don't know how to drive, so I won't get too far

Never using condoms, I fuck bitches wearing bitches!
Now my bitch in pain, the other needs some stitches
My bitches they train, so bitches ain't bitches
Cause when I take a nap someone need to work the kitchen

[Refrain]

[Borgore:]
I got bitches who want my beach, when my bitches on vacation
No GPS, bitches know what's my location
Not using phone, I'm on a headless flex
Bitches wear my tees, I send them as my text

I don't need no pool, I'm making bitches wet
I got so much pussy, I use bitches as my pet
I'm so lazy, I'm so lazy
But if you had my life, you wouldn't fucking blame me!

[Shay:]
This life is weird, not sure how to say it
I'm just claiming random shit, and these bitches obey it
Got a bitch for every tweet, and one for every need
I got farmer bitches, science bitches all getting my weed

Buy a case, they can't supply with haze, kush and cheese
Only here the finest bushes, bitches wanna please
Didn't say a thing and they already on their knees
All these anorexic bitches are surviving on my jizz

[Refrain]
