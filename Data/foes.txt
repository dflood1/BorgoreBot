The handsome B.R.G
Ye-yeeah!
Gorestep volume 1.1
Hope you enjoy!
ROCK!

[Hook:]
All them backstabbing foes
Standing in my way, always stepping on my toes
Stealing my style even wearing my clothes
Fuck all them haters fuck all them hoes
[x2]

[Verse 1 - Borgore:]
So
Fuck all them haters
Saying that my music's not deep
I'm gonna show these tree huggers how deep they can suck dick
And while everyone's practicing all this ambient dub shit
The handsome B.R.G. is the one to raise the notch a bit

So
Fuck all them haters
Saying that my music's mid-range
Strange, I got so many pussy, I can spare you with change
All these bitches treat me like I'm a rockstar
While my music conquered continents
Yours doesn't get so far

So
Fuck all them haters
While they're busy studying the ABC
My words aren't so basic Coltrane and Stravinsky
It's always been part of my life
We close like Clinton and Lewinsky
So what you fucking fool? You think that you can fucking teach me

Fuck all them haters
Saying that my lyric's too radical
I can't call you a man
You don't pass the the minimum of one testicle
I've heard that your girl likes to wear the strap-on
And that you bleed so fucking hard you need to shove a tampon

[Hook:]
All them backstabbing foes
Standing in my way, always stepping on my toes
Stealing my style even wearing my clothes
Fuck all them haters so fuck all them hoes
[x2]

[Verse 2 - Shay:]
Yo, I fly as a meteor, man
I'm wittier, prettier
Then these motherfucking foes which I be easy superior
When inferior
My man aye, yo, just listen
I rape this fucking beat
And then I beat it to submission
I'm saying
Fuck these foes
I'm saying fuck the intermission
I'm saying
Fuck these foes
I know exactly what you thinking, foney
How ass kissing and dissin' and started wishin they can be me
Its like i got everybody convinced except for I
But still I'm on the road to sky-high
Off to the bigger and better not saying goodbye
Always saying I would never settle in for miles
Still I never questioned friends
Cause you can't spell friends with an Y

[Hook:]
All them backstabbing foes
Standing in my way, always stepping on my toes
Stealing my style even wearing my clothes
Fuck all them haters so fuck all them hoes
[x2]
