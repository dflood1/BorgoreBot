[G-Eazy:]
They pay me to step in the club (Yeah)
I blow it on strippers and drugs (I do)
Forever finessing the plug
Got rich and I learned what the difference was
Looked at the top and said, “Bitch, I want all this”
Young with new money, I'm rich and obnoxious
On multiple drugs, now this shit got me nauseous
A cowboy, I’m reckless and lawless
Look, I win the awards and I sell out my tours
I need me a Natalie Portman like Thor’s
Matter fact, she’s just what I’m working towards
And I got the juice like I’m hooked up on chords
Party tonight at Borgore’s
Don’t talk to me like I’m average, bitch, we’re lords
Look, mama, I made it to Forbes
Look, mama, I made it to Forbes

[G-Eazy:]
It's just things are just different now, you know? It's just...

[G-Eazy:]
And if it ain’t lit I won’t stick around
I’m high off some of the best shit I found
And I don't chase girls, I’m just picking now (Yeah)
I guess things are just different now
And yeah, yeah, she knows what I’m thinking now (Yeah)
Luckily everything’s quicker now
I pour me a drink and I drink it down
Room full of boppers then I swing my dick around
They say when it’s raining, it pours
I mean champagne showers of course
And my chick’s way badder than yours
No, I don’t fuck with average fours
I cut fast like samurai swords
That boy he just works and records (Yeah)
Mama, I made it to Forbes
Look, mama, I made it to Forbes
