Drinking till I throw up, I don't give a fuck
Not sure that I'll make it home depending on my luck
It won't be my first, nor will be my second
I do what I want, bitches calling me a legend

Drinking till I throw up, I don't give a fuck
Not sure that I'll make it home depending on my luck
It won't be my first, nor will be my second
I do what I want, bitches calling me a legend

Drinking till I throw up, drinking till I die
All my life feels like I'm living in a lie
So I won't waste a minute, I won't waste a second
I do what I want so I'ma die a legend
