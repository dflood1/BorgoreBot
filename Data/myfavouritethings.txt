Diamonds and pearls and rich greedy husbands
Haters and fakers that being hunted
Listening to our movie scene
These are a few of my favorite things
Watching the faces when one of my tune drops
Having those raves with one of them big cups
Staying in fit while have been done fighting
These are a few of my favorite things

When they mock me
Try to stop me
And I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

(Haters) [x2]

Don't try to stop me
Haters
[x2]

Haters
