Something real
Something I can't put my finger on
You've got me out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my...

Out of my...
Out of my...
Something real
Something I can't put my finger on
You've got me out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind

Down me falling now
I can't see clearly sun now
You've got me out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my...

Out of my...
Out of my...
Something real
Something I can't put my finger on
You've got me out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
