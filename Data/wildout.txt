[Verse 1 - Waka Flocka Flame:]
Jurassic Park
Iâ€™m in a hardspot, little hole in the wall
Threw twenty racks, I just blacked out
Hot as fuck, 'bout to pass out
My swag in, your swag out
When I hit the stage, girls titties out
When I hit your stage bring your city out
Ballin' hard, 'bout to foul out
Pop a bottle nigga, wild out
You know, wild, wild out
Pop a bottle nigga, wild out
I'm slim dunkin' with these Ray Bans
I'm on a thug shit, campaigns
Still champagne, need a bad bitch
Icy wrist with with a icy neck
Reach for that, I'll leave you wet
Waka Flocka Flame get the pussy wet

[Verse 2 - Paige:]
Gettin' money ain't a crime
So why you watching, wasting time
Tell me are you ready
Hit the streets and we wild out
Club hopping we ball out
And ain't watching no haters 'cus ya'll

[Bridge:]
Can't fuck with us, can't fuck with us
Can't fuck with us, we get crazy
Come fuck with us, come fuck with us
Hit the street, we wild out, Club hopping we ball out
Come fuck with us [x4]
Pop a bottle nigga, wild out
Hit the street, we wild out, Club hopping we ball out [x2]

[Drop:] Turn up the volume!

[Verse 3 - Paige:]
Money, money, no running out
I don't know what you talking 'bout
Tell me if you ready
Bad bitch with a foul mouth
What the fuck you hating for
Give me a round of applause
I'm in first place like Usain
Too true like 2 Chainz

[Bridge]
