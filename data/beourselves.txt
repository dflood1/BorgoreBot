Let's get high, let's get faded
Just forget this life's complicated
Let's get drunk, let's get wasted
Make mistakes we won't regret it

Let's get high, lets get faded
Just forget this life's complicated
Lets get drunk, let's get wasted
Make mistakes we won't regret it

Let's be ourselves
Let's be ourselves and just get naked

Let's get faded
Take it off

Let's get high, let's get faded
Just forget this life's complicated
Let's get drunk, let's get wasted
Make mistakes we won't regret it

Lets get high, lets get faded
Just forget this life's complicated
Lets get drunk, lets get wasted
Make mistakes we won't regret it

Let's be ourselves
Let's be ourselves and just get naked

Let's get faded
Take it off
