Sneak into your dreams because I know how much you love when you sleep
Watching how the wolf just sits there patiently and counting his sheep

Recognize the monster that you've made with words that came from your mouth
Used to be my northern star, but now you're just a boy from the south

And you're bad but I like it bad
The only type that's in my bed, you know it
And I'm scared you're getting in my head
I'm not the type to be mislead, you know it

Sneak into your dreams because I know how much you love when you sleep
Watching how the wolf just sits there patiently and counting his sheep

Recognize the monster that you've made with words that came from your mouth
Used to be my northern star, but now you're just a boy from the south

And you're bad...

And you're bad but I like it bad
The only type that's in my bed, you know it
And I'm scared you're getting in my head
I'm not the type to be mislead, you know it

You're a big bad, big bad
You're a big bad, big bad wolf
