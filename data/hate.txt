I can't describe love
But I can feel it
My heart's protected
But she can steal it

I can't describe love
But I can feel it
My heart is broken
But she can heal it

She's a good girl
She's like an angel
She's just like Taylor
Or even better

She's a good girl
She's like an angel
She's just like Taylor
So I fuck her like I hate her!
