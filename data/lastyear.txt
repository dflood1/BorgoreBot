This won't be my last year, see this is a promise
Five years in, I'm still here. I'm gonna win, I got this
Even if I die tomorrow, I still promise you
Maybe twenty years your daughter will be playing with my hologram
This won't be my last year, see this is a promise
Five years in, I'm still here. I'm gonna win, I got this
Even if I die tomorrow, I still have a legacy
Your daughter will rave to my songs while getting turnt on ecstasy

This won't be my last year cause I still have plans
I want my SLS, a leopard costume Benz
I wanna party hard, I wanna have a chance
To have Victoria's Secret as my Twitter fans
I wanna get drunk, I wanna fuck bitches
I want Taylor Swift to send me nude pictures
I want more money, I want more power
Fuck the Trump, I want my own tower

I made it to the top, with my middle finger
If you don't like me then I don't like you either
This won't be my last year, the turn up just won't let me
I'm not yet a father but your sister calls me (daddy)

This won't be my last year, see this is a promise
Five years in, I'm still here. I'm gonna win, I got this
Even if I die tomorrow, I still promise you
Maybe twenty years your daughter will be playing with my hologram
This won't be my last year, see this is a promise
Five years in, I'm still here. I'm gonna win, I got this
Even if I die tomorrow, I still have a legacy
Your daughter will rave to my songs while getting turnt on ecstasy

This won't be my last year, I wanna be the president
I wanna see more tits than a plastic surgeon
I wanna swim in cash, I wanna swim in papers
I want to buy a lake, I want to buy the Lakers

I made it to the top, with my middle finger
If you don't like me then I don't like you either
This won't be my last year, the turn up just won't let me
I'm not yet a father but your sister calls me (daddy)

This won't be my last year, see this is a promise
Five years in, I'm still here. I'm gonna win, I got this
Even if I die tomorrow, I still promise you
Maybe twenty years your daughter will be playing with my hologram
This won't be my last year, see this is a promise
Five years in, I'm still here. I'm gonna win, I got this
Even if I die tomorrow, I still have a legacy
Your daughter will rave to my songs while getting turnt on ecstasy

This won't be my last year
