Borgore, what's good?

I can get so high up in the sky, you need a parachute
Bet a 100 mil on the grind, bet I never lose
I just blew by 35 hundred on a pair of shoes
That I don't even like, I just bought them for tonight
I just called another flight, I just signed another check
Told my pilot take me to the money, gone in 60 seconds (poof)
Gone in thin air like a magic trick
Got that type of money make a stripper cut a backwards flip

Got that type of money
Got that type of money
Got that type of money
Type of money
Got that type of money
Got that type of
Got that type of money
Make a stripper cut a backwards flip
Poof, gone in thin air like a magic trick

I threw a yacht party somewhere of the Cayman Islands
I had a 100 bad bitches and a plate of salmon
Got this one chick in particular, she outstanding
But if she don't get no molly, she gon' throw a tantrum
At this Vegas pool party, you know I don't do no swimming
Unless you talking 'bout these women in that case I'm all up in it
Took a week off in Las Vegas, I ain't doing shit but spending
I saw Draya at the Palm's, I'm like "damn the girl can get it"

Got that type of money
Got that type of money
Got that type of money
Type of money
Got that type of money
Got that type of
Got that type of money
Make a stripper cut a backwards flip
Poof, gone in thin air like a magic trick
