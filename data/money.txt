I might have kids around the world
But I wouldn't fucking know
'Cause I've got so many bitches
That I'm in a vertigo
And I can not use a rubber
'Cause I'm so fucking skint
That when I go to a store
I can't buy a lousy mint

I own a Lamborghini
It's just a small model
My friend want it 'cause I'm in debt
So we had to royal rumble
He has this hot girl
They're like the beauty and the beast
'Cause I broke his fucking teeth
And can't afford a dentist

Yes, we can 
No we can't 'cause I don't know no one that owns money
I would have fucking cry
But the situation is kind of funny
Borgore, what would you do if you'd be like, filthy rich
I'll buy the Olsen Twins and a private beach

I'm selling fucking tunes
Punishing different women
What can I say, bitches love my seamen
I'm always on the grind
But Its not for fucking skengz
I'm a motherfucking player with no money in the bank
(Money in the bank..)
