Sometimes I feel like I'm dropped I my work and the stress will kill me
Sometimes I don't know what's up and down but I nowhere I wane be
And that won't bring me down
I won't let it beat me
I know the day will come and I will be set free
I will be set free

Sometimes I feel like I'm different from them and I question what's wrong with me
Sometimes I feel like they change who I am this is who I wane be
But that won't bring me down
I won't let it beat me I know the day will come and I will be set free
I will be set free
I will be set free
