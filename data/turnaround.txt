She says I'm a cheater
She heard from a friend that I fucked her best friend and her friend
I had better sex
But I don't complain cause its better than my hand
She don't understand
How could I tell her that she's getting fatter
She haven’t stopped eating since I have first met her
And I could have noticed her jeans screams surrender
I'm no Hellen Keller
She says we haven’t made love for over a month
But head is the only way to shut her mouth
And if she didn't swallow then I'd leave the house
She says it's my drinking affecting my actions the way that I'm thinking
She threatened she's leaving
She heads to the door and all I could say is
Turn around
Lets make up and make out

She says I'm a liar
She heard from a friend that her best friend fucked my whole band
Theres only one member so I guess we had sex and I don’t remember
She's always on Twitter
I see her dming some dudes that’s she's bitter
On Insta no filter
Left her a comment #TBT you looked fitter
She says I'm a child
Xbox all day won't get me a bride
I tell her she's childish not sucking dick will make her a sidebitch
She's blaming my smoking
Tired of me getting snapchats of twerking
She says it's not working
She heads to the door and all I could say is
Turn around
Lets make up and make out
